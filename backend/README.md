# 🧩 Puzzle Shop Backend

This is the backend API for Puzzle Shop — an eCommerce platform focused on selling Rubik's cubes, mechanical puzzles, and brain teasers. Built using NestJS, Mongoose, and JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- ⚙️ NestJS (TypeScript)
- 🧬 MongoDB with Mongoose
- 🔐 JWT authentication (access + refresh tokens)
- 🍪 Cookie-based secure storage (httpOnly for refresh tokens)
- 📦 RESTful API structure

---

## 🔐 Authentication

The backend uses a stateless access/refresh token system:

- access_token: short-lived (e.g. 15 min), sent in Authorization header.
- refresh_token: long-lived (e.g. 7 days), sent via httpOnly secure cookie.
- You can refresh tokens via a POST /auth/refresh endpoint.
